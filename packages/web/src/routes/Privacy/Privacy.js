                You are not legally required to provide us with any Personal Data, but without it, we will not be able
                to provide you with the full range or with the best experience of using our Services (for instance, you

              </p>
              <p>
                We collect four main categories of data (and to the extent it relates to a personally identifiable
                individual, we will deem it as "<strong>Personal Data</strong>"):
              </p>
              <p>
                <strong>Data automatically collected or generated:</strong> when someone visits, interacts with, or uses
                our Services, including any e-mail or text messages sent to them by us or via our Services, we may
                collect or generate technical data about them. We collect or generate such data either independently or
                with the help of third-party services.
              </p>
              <p>
                <strong>Data received from you:</strong> you may provide us Personal Data voluntarily, such as your name
                and E-mail address when you contact us, your hashed password, your content, and images (including
                details regarding your events or other announcements, if you choose to submit them as you use the
                Services), when you post on our public forums or groups when you sign-up to receive E-mail updates, when
                you place any purchases via our Services, or when you choose to connect your Facebook or Google account
                to our Services.
              </p>
              <p>
                You may also provide us with the Personal Data of your Recipients, namely their names and E-mail
                addresses. We may collect additional information concerning such Recipients (namely, analytics data
                concerning their interactions with the content and invitations you sent them and their responses to such
                invitations – all on your behalf, so you could better manage your events).
              </p>
              <p>
                <strong>Data received from Facebook, Google, and other channels:</strong> If you choose to connect your
                Facebook or Google account to our Services, we will receive access to your full name and user ID on
                Facebook or Google. You may also allow us to access your images saved on such services so that you could
                fetch these images and use them on our Services. Such access will also allow us to collect: your profile
                picture, gender, date of birth, comments on our company page, tags and tagged pictures, locale, and time
                zone.

                <strong>Transaction Data:</strong> Our Services allow you to place purchases. Currently, all purchases
                must be completed either with a credit card or via PayPal, which will provide us with limited data
                concerning your order. We will not collect or store your financial data, e.g., your credit card numbers
                or bank account. We may still receive your non-financial Personal Data related to your order, such as
                your name, PayPal username/e-mail, billing and shipping address, and the items purchased and paid
                amount, to fulfill your purchase and for our accounting purposes.
